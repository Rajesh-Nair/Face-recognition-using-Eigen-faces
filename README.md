# Face recognition using Eigen faces

Here, in this project we would use dataset - Olivetti's faces for our study on Eigen faces. If you would like to learn the theory behind Eigen faces, please read the blog below that I've written.

We would do some analysis on the dataset , and try to understand how PCA and Eigen help us recognize or regenerate the faces. We would create some model to train and predict the faces, also try to understand their drawbacks. We will create our final model based on all our analysis, to see how we can recognize the faces in best possible way. For ease, we have split the analysis and final model in separate notebook.

Happy learning !
